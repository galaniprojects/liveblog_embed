## Liveblog embed

Adds a new link-field to the liveblog post which allows the saving of multiple 
non-specific urls which will be automatically embedded via the yaem module.

When creating a liveblog post, the editor can post urls into the input field.
If the url can be embedded, it will generate a preview and the editor can
decide whether the url should be embedded or just shown as a link.
